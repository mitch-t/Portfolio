# Portfolio
This is my second small project that I have worked on. I'm currently a student at UCR's coding boot camp.
This project utilizes links to pages and personal information. Each page has a link that connects to the other pages.
During this project I learned how to incorporate bootstrap to create a navigation bar with a drop down menu. 
I also used bootstrap to create columns and rows on the Portfolio.html. I plan on creating a rates page and possibly a form
for users to import their information. I plan on adding and improving on this project as I acquire more skills.
